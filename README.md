# This is my "first" Web Page

I'm following instructions the user centric front end development module of the code institute course.
So far, I have been using Html and CSS to structure and style this basic site which links images and text to outside sources, namely wikipedia.
During the course of this section, I have also learned about and how to use git and GitHub.

Thanks to Wikipedia for, well, everything they do ;)
and kudos to google images
